### 🚀 **How to Monitor Your Trading**

When you start the FastAPI server, you'll see all these logs in real-time:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\alpyaman\Desktop\Projects\Crypto_Trading\Crypto_Trading\backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### **Option 2: Use the Test Script**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\alpyaman\Desktop\Projects\Crypto_Trading\Crypto_Trading\backend
python test_trading_logs.py
```
Choose option 2 to monitor trading status every 30 seconds.

#### **Option 3: Check API Endpoints**
- Trading status: `GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/enhanced/trading/status`
- Account info: `GET http://localhost:8000/api/account/futures`

### 🎯 **What You Should See Now**

When enhanced trading is active, you should see logs like:
1. **Every 5 minutes:** Complete trading analysis cycle
2. **Real-time:** ML predictions and confidence scores
3. **When conditions change:** Risk warnings or trade executions
4. **Clear reasons:** Why trades are or aren't being placed

### 🔧 **If You Still Don't See Trading**

Common reasons and solutions:
1. **Low Confidence:** ML model confidence < 60% - normal in ranging markets
2. **High Risk/Volatility:** Market conditions too risky - protective feature
3. **Weak Trends:** Model waiting for stronger market signals
4. **Model Loading Issues:** Check if enhanced model is properly loaded

### 📊 **Next Steps**

1. **Start Enhanced Trading** via the GUI Trading page
2. **Monitor the terminal** where uvicorn is running
3. **Check logs every 5 minutes** for detailed analysis
4. **Use test script** for API-based monitoring

The system is now much more transparent about what it's doing and why!
