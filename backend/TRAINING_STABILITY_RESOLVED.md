# Enhanced ML Training Stability - RESOLVED ✅

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**: Training Instability Fixed

### **Before (Original Issue)**
```
| train/                  |           |
|    loss                 | 1.23e+24  |  ❌ UNSTABLE
|    value_loss           | 1.65e+24  |  ❌ EXPLODING
|    explained_variance   | 0         |  ❌ NO LEARNING
```

### **After (With VecNormalize)**
```
| train/                  |           |
|    loss                 | -0.103    |  ✅ STABLE
|    value_loss           | 0.00445   |  ✅ EXCELLENT
|    explained_variance   | 0.945     |  ✅ 94.5% LEARNING
```

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**: VecNormalize + Monitor

### **Key Changes Made**
1. **Added imports**: `VecNormalize`, `Monitor` from stable_baselines3.common
2. **Wrapped training env**: `Monitor(env)` → `DummyVecEnv` → `VecNormalize(norm_obs=True, norm_reward=True, clip_obs=10.0)`
3. **Saved normalization stats**: `vec_norm.save()` after training
4. **Load at inference**: `VecNormalize.load()` in `load_enhanced_model()`
5. **Normalize predictions**: Apply same normalization during `predict_enhanced()`

### **Why This Fixed The Problem**
- **Observation normalization**: 86 features with different scales → normalized to mean=0, std=1
- **Reward normalization**: Large episode rewards (3e13) → normalized scale for stable critic updates
- **Clipping**: Extreme outliers clipped to [-10, 10] preventing NaN propagation
- **Consistent train/inference**: Same normalization applied during training and prediction
